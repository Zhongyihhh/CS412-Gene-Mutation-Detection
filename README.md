# CS412-Gene-Mutation-Detection

# Project Description
A ‘motif’ is a pattern in a sequence. For example, in DNA sequences (which are sequences over the alphabet {A,C,G,T}), an example of a motif is the pattern ‘TCACGTG’. A slightly more complex motif is the pattern TC[A/C]CGTG, which represents ‘either TCACGTG or TCCCGTG’. An occurrence of a motif in a given DNA sequence is called a ‘site’.
